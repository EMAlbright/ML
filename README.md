This project demonstrates how to build a simple linear regression model using PyTorch. It covers data preparation, model building, training, and evaluation. A synthetic dataset is created and split into training and testing sets, after which a linear regression model is defined and trained using Mean Absolute Error loss and Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer.
